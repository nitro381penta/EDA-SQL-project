Report on the MLops
-----------------------
- I had several issues with finding the right commands for my MacBook and to be able to extract a requirements file.
- Then I had to create a token to be able to access to my GitHub through the terminal.
- I had to create a conda venv while my colleague was creating a python environment so it was difficult to install the requirements for running each others code.
- In the end the code worked but there was an absolute file path that prohibited accessing the file and loading the csv.
